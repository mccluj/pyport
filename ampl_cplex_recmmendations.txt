I have a difficult AMPL/CLEX portfolio optimization problem to solve. When I use ampl options randseed=1234 and presolve=0 and cplex options nodelim=2000. It solves with solve_result_num 421 "node limit with integer solution found".  When I add additional cplex options mipgap=1e-8 and integrality=5e-9, it solves with a solve_result_num 410 "node limit without integer solution found".  What is going on with these additional parameters.  How should i rationally set up my ampl/cplex problems going forward?


ChatGPT said:
You're encountering different AMPL/CPLEX outcomes due to the specific settings of the solver parameters (mipgap and integrality) and their interactions with the node limit. Let's first clearly understand what's happening and then rationally approach future setups.

What's Going On?
Explanation of your specific situation:

Initially, with:

nginx
Copy code
ampl options randseed=1234 presolve=0;
cplex options nodelim=2000;
Your model finds an integer solution within the specified node limit (solve_result_num 421: "node limit with integer solution found"). This means CPLEX found at least one feasible integer solution (though not proven optimal) before hitting the 2000-node limit.

When you add more stringent solver parameters:

nginx
Copy code
cplex options mipgap=1e-8 integrality=5e-9;
you significantly tighten the criteria for optimality and integrality:

mipgap=1e-8: demands extremely tight optimality gap (relative difference between best integer solution found and the best known LP bound).

integrality=5e-9: sets an extremely strict integrality tolerance, requiring solutions to be integer within an extremely small tolerance.

Due to these tight tolerances, CPLEX struggles to certify an integer solution within your 2000-node limit. Although it previously found integer solutions with default (or looser) tolerances, tightening these tolerances can effectively invalidate previous "good enough" solutions—causing CPLEX to discard solutions that no longer meet these rigorous criteria.

Thus, under these stringent settings, CPLEX hits the node limit without producing a feasible integer solution that satisfies your new criteria (solve_result_num 410: "node limit without integer solution found").

Rational Approach for AMPL/CPLEX Setup
1. Clearly Understand Solver Parameters
nodelim:
Limits the maximum number of nodes explored. Too low of a limit may prevent finding optimal solutions; too high may significantly increase computation time.

mipgap:
Controls the acceptable gap between best known integer solution and the best LP relaxation bound. Smaller gaps mean more precision but can drastically increase solve times.

integrality:
Defines the tolerance of integer feasibility. Lower values enforce higher precision but significantly complicate numeric calculations and can cause rounding issues.

2. Recommended Practices
Start with defaults first:
Don't initially set extremely strict tolerances unless explicitly needed.

Incremental Tightening:
First find a feasible solution quickly with looser criteria, then incrementally tighten tolerances if higher precision is truly needed.

Balance Node Limits and Tolerances:
When tightening parameters, increase nodelim or time limits to ensure CPLEX has enough resources to find solutions meeting stricter criteria.

Use Diagnostic Outputs:
Run with display _varname; or use AMPL's diagnostic options (display solve_message; display solve_result_num;) to inspect intermediate solutions and solver behaviors.

Numeric Stability Awareness:
Extremely tight tolerances (integrality < 1e-7, mipgap < 1e-7) typically create numerical instability or excessive runtimes. Aim for practical, realistic tolerance levels.

3. Suggested Rational Defaults (for typical financial/portfolio optimization problems):
Start with defaults, then use:

ampl
Copy code
ampl options presolve=1;   # Enable AMPL presolve (typically beneficial)
cplex options:
    mipgap=1e-5 to 1e-6,   # Generally sufficient for portfolio optimization
    integrality=1e-6,      # Numeric stability
    nodelim=5000 to 10000, # Allow more nodes for exploration if necessary
    threads=0;             # Let CPLEX manage parallel threads automatically
4. If Precise Solutions are Required:
After initial optimization, carefully tighten criteria if truly needed:

ampl
Copy code
cplex options mipgap=1e-8 integrality=1e-8 nodelim=20000;
Monitor solver status (solve_result_num, solve_message) to assess numeric feasibility.

Summary & Next Steps:
Your current problem is caused by overly stringent solver parameters within limited computational budget (nodelim).

Rationally approach AMPL/CPLEX parameter tuning incrementally, balancing precision, stability, and computational feasibility.

Avoid extremely strict criteria (integrality < 1e-8) unless required for regulatory, academic, or scientific rigor, as numeric instability is common.

This structured approach helps manage optimization complexity effectively and avoids encountering unexpected outcomes like those you're seeing now.







You said:
My portfolio optimization problems are in weight space, meaning the sum of the portfolio weights (for long-only) is 1.0, and I typically have 3-5000 candidate stocks of which 500-1000 would be in the final solution.  Does that change the recommended values for mipgap and integrality?


ChatGPT said:
Yes, the specific context of your portfolio optimization problem—involving thousands of candidate stocks, long-only constraints (weights summing to 1.0), and a substantial number (500-1000) of positions in the final solution—definitely influences your recommended solver settings, especially regarding mipgap and integrality.

Let's analyze this more carefully to guide your setup rationally.

Implications of your Problem Context:
Large-scale integer problem:

With 3,000–5,000 candidate securities and selecting ~500–1,000, you have a large mixed-integer optimization problem.

The scale (thousands of binary/integer variables and constraints) significantly impacts computational complexity and numerical stability.

Weight-space constraints:

Your solutions will involve relatively small weight increments, particularly as you diversify across many securities.

Numerical precision on these weights matters, especially if regulatory or practical precision constraints exist (e.g., minimum trade sizes, minimum portfolio weights).

High dimensionality and sparsity:

Sparsity (only a subset selected) generally increases complexity and can trigger numerical instability if tolerances are too strict.

Recommended Rational Parameter Values for Your Context:
Given your specific problem characteristics, here’s how you should approach each parameter:

1. mipgap Recommendation:
The mipgap controls the precision of the optimality gap between the best integer solution and the best-known bound.

Recommended mipgap value	Reasoning
1e-5 to 1e-6 (0.001% - 0.0001%)	Usually sufficient for financial optimization. Lower (1e-8) may cause prolonged computations without practical benefit.
1e-7 (0.00001%)	Maximum precision level advisable if required by regulatory compliance or precision benchmarking, but at significant computational cost.
Conclusion:

Start with mipgap=1e-6.

Only go lower if the precise optimality gap has substantial financial or regulatory implications.

2. integrality Recommendation:
The integrality setting defines numeric precision required for integer feasibility.

In a large-scale integer optimization scenario (portfolio weight-space problem), extremely small integrality tolerances risk numerical instability without tangible benefit.

Recommended integrality value	Reasoning
1e-6 to 1e-7	Realistic tolerance for practical portfolio weights; balances numeric stability and solution feasibility.
Below 1e-8 (e.g., 5e-9)	Typically unnecessary and risks instability; solutions differ insignificantly from slightly looser tolerances.
Conclusion:

Start with integrality=1e-6 for robust, numerically stable portfolio solutions.

Consider reducing to 1e-7 only if tighter constraints or precise validation criteria explicitly require it.

3. Node Limit (nodelim) Recommendation:
Your earlier setting (nodelim=2000) is quite restrictive given your problem’s complexity.

Recommended nodelim value	Reasoning
10000 to 50000	Larger-scale portfolio optimizations generally require significantly more exploration.
Adjust incrementally	Based on runtime behavior and feasibility status, increase incrementally rather than starting excessively high.
Conclusion:

Consider raising your node limit initially to at least nodelim=10000–20000.

Increase further only if required by observed solver behavior.

Recommended AMPL/CPLEX Configuration Example:
A balanced rational starting point for your scenario is:

ampl
Copy code
ampl options presolve=1 randseed=1234;

option solver cplex;

option cplex_options 'mipgap=1e-6 integrality=1e-6 nodelim=20000 threads=0';
Start here to ensure numerical stability, computational feasibility, and sufficiently accurate solutions.

Iteratively tighten criteria (mipgap=1e-7, integrality=1e-7) only if explicitly needed and computationally feasible.

Practical Recommendations for Your Optimization Workflow:
Initial solutions:

Run with somewhat looser criteria first (mipgap=1e-6, integrality=1e-6) to quickly obtain feasible and near-optimal solutions.

Refinement step:

If strict precision is necessary, subsequently tighten parameters incrementally (e.g., mipgap=1e-7), but only after verifying that looser tolerances result in practically significant differences.

Diagnostics and Checks:

Regularly check solver statuses (solve_result_num, solve_message).

Assess numeric stability and actual economic significance of tighter constraints.

Summary:
Recommended defaults for your scenario:

mipgap: 1e-6 (tight enough for portfolio applications, numeric stability)

integrality: 1e-6 (numerically stable and sufficient for portfolio weights)

nodelim: 20,000+ (provides sufficient exploration space for large problems)

Adjust tighter only if needed and ensure numeric and computational feasibility.







You said:
Are there other cplex options to consider, e.g. absmipgap? Ditto for AMPL options.


ChatGPT said:
Yes, in addition to mipgap and integrality, other CPLEX and AMPL solver parameters could significantly influence your portfolio optimization workflow. Let's carefully review the most relevant ones, including absmipgap and AMPL-specific options.

Key CPLEX Options to Consider
① Absolute MIP Gap (absmipgap)
Purpose:
Defines an absolute (rather than relative) gap between the best known integer solution and the best known LP bound.

∣bestInteger−bestBound∣≤absmipgap

Use Case (Portfolio Optimization):
Particularly useful if portfolio objective values are already close to zero or if relative gaps become misleading due to very small magnitudes.

Recommended Usage:
Usually not needed unless your objective values are tiny or you experience numeric issues using mipgap.

ampl
Copy code
option cplex_options 'absmipgap=1e-5';
② Numerical Stability (numericalemphasis)
Purpose:
Helps resolve numeric issues in large, numerically challenging problems.

Use Case:
Valuable for portfolio problems with thousands of variables, small increments, and precision-sensitive objectives.

Recommended Usage:
Set this option when numeric difficulties arise.

ampl
Copy code
option cplex_options 'numericalemphasis=1';  # Mild numeric emphasis
# or
option cplex_options 'numericalemphasis=2';  # Strong numeric emphasis
③ Emphasis Parameters (mipemphasis)
Purpose:
Guides CPLEX toward a particular solving strategy.

Setting	Description	When to use?
mipemphasis=1	Feasibility emphasis	Quickly find feasible solutions
mipemphasis=2	Optimality emphasis	Tighten bounds aggressively
mipemphasis=3	Moving best bound	Effective if you're stuck with large gaps
mipemphasis=4	Hidden feasible solutions	Good if solutions seem hard to find
Recommended Usage:
Often valuable in large-scale portfolio optimizations. Usually start with default (0), but consider switching if encountering specific solver behaviors (e.g., feasibility issues):

ampl
Copy code
option cplex_options 'mipemphasis=1';
④ Time and Resource Management (timelimit, threads)
Purpose:

timelimit: sets the maximum runtime in seconds.

threads: controls parallel execution (default threads=0 lets CPLEX use available cores).

Recommended Usage: Essential for large-scale, computationally intense problems:

ampl
Copy code
option cplex_options 'timelimit=3600 threads=0';  # 1-hour limit, auto-threading
⑤ Solution Pool (populate, solnpoolcapacity)
Purpose:
Finds and retains multiple feasible solutions (portfolio alternatives) simultaneously.

Use Case:
Excellent for evaluating multiple near-optimal portfolio solutions.

Recommended Usage: Useful in practical portfolio analysis to review several competitive solutions:

ampl
Copy code
option cplex_options 'populate=1 solnpoolcapacity=10';
AMPL-specific options worth considering
① Presolve (presolve)
Purpose:
AMPL's built-in presolver simplifies problems before sending them to CPLEX, potentially speeding solve times.

Recommended Usage: Usually beneficial; keep enabled unless debugging numeric issues explicitly:

ampl
Copy code
option presolve 1;  # usually default and beneficial
② Random Seed (randseed)
Purpose:
Controls solver randomization. Useful for reproducibility.

Recommended Usage: Critical for debugging or comparing solver runs:

ampl
Copy code
option randseed 1234;
③ Scale Control (scale)
Purpose:
Controls problem scaling, enhancing numeric stability.

Recommended Usage: If numeric instability arises, explicitly scaling can help:

ampl
Copy code
option scale 1;  # enable scaling (usually default)
Recommended Rational Setup (AMPL & CPLEX) for Your Context:
Combining the most practical settings for your described scenario, a recommended rational baseline would be:

AMPL Setup:
ampl
Copy code
option solver cplex;

option presolve 1;
option randseed 1234;
option scale 1;  # default usually fine
CPLEX Solver Setup:
ampl
Copy code
option cplex_options '
    mipgap=1e-6 
    integrality=1e-6 
    nodelim=20000 
    threads=0
    numericalemphasis=1
    mipemphasis=0  # start default, adjust based on observed issues
    timelimit=3600
';
Additional (situational) options (use selectively based on problem specifics or numeric behavior):

ampl
Copy code
# Absolute gap, if relative gap problematic:
absmipgap=1e-5  

# Feasibility emphasis, if integer solutions difficult:
mipemphasis=1  

# Multiple solutions, useful for alternatives evaluation:
populate=1 solnpoolcapacity=5
Rational Usage & Workflow Recommendations:
Initial Run (balanced default):

Start with recommended baseline (above).

Run with moderate node limit and numeric stability settings.

If numerical instability arises:

Adjust numericalemphasis=2

Loosen integrality (to 1e-5) slightly.

If solving too slow / stuck:

Relax mipgap (1e-5 rather than 1e-6).

Increase feasibility emphasis (mipemphasis=1).

If multiple solutions valuable:

Add populate=1 and solnpoolcapacity.

Summary of Key Points for Your Problem:
Parameter	Recommended	Reason
mipgap	1e-6	Tight but numerically stable for portfolios
integrality	1e-6	Balances precision and numeric stability
absmipgap	Typically not required	Only use if relative gap insufficient
numericalemphasis	1 (default) or 2	Improve numeric stability
mipemphasis	0 (default) or 1	Adjust based on feasibility challenges
threads	0 (auto)	Maximum performance via parallel execution
nodelim	20000+	Allow solver sufficient search capacity
timelimit	3600 (or as practical)	Ensures practical run times
populate	Optional	Multiple solution alternatives
AMPL: presolve	1 (enabled)	Simplifies model and speeds solving
AMPL: randseed	fixed (e.g., 1234)	For reproducible results
Conclusion:
Consider these options carefully based on observed solver behaviors and numeric stability in your large-scale portfolio problems. Incremental refinement and situational adjustments are key to robust, efficient, and rational optimization.
