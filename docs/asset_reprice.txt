The overall structure you've described does not appear to be inherently complicated. In fact, it seems to follow a logical and modular design that separates concerns appropriately.

Here's an analysis of each component:

1. Generic AssetPrice structure: Having a generic `AssetPrice` structure with subtypes such as `StockPrice` and `OptionPrice` allows for flexibility and extensibility. It enables you to handle different types of assets and their associated price information in a structured manner.

2. Asset.reprice(): Defining a `reprice()` method in the `Asset` class that returns an `AssetPrice` object is a reasonable approach. It encapsulates the logic for repricing an asset and provides a consistent interface for obtaining the updated price information.

3. HoldingPrice structure: The `HoldingPrice` structure, which includes an `AssetPrice` member along with other holding-specific attributes, allows you to combine the asset price information with additional details related to the holding. This can be useful for managing and analyzing the overall value and characteristics of a holding.

4. Holding.reprice(): Having a `reprice()` method in the `Holding` class that updates a holding's price structure member without returning anything is a valid approach. This ensures that the holding's internal state is appropriately updated without the need for a specific return value.

Overall, the design you've outlined appears to be modular and allows for clear separation of concerns. It facilitates code organization, maintainability, and reusability. However, it's important to ensure that the implementation details within each component are appropriately managed and adhere to sound software engineering principles.

As with any design, it's recommended to carefully plan and document your system architecture, follow established coding practices, and consider the specific requirements and constraints of your application.



If the `Asset.reprice()` method only returns an `AssetPrice` structure and there is no need to store the price as a member variable within the `Asset` class, it is reasonable not to have a `price` member variable associated with `Asset`.

Here are a few points to consider:

1. Separation of Concerns: By separating the repricing logic into a separate method (`reprice()`) and returning the `AssetPrice` structure, you keep the responsibility of managing and storing the price information within the `AssetPrice` structure itself. This promotes a more modular and cohesive design.

2. Reduced Redundancy: If the primary goal of the `Asset` class is not to maintain and provide direct access to the price, omitting the `price` member variable avoids redundancy and unnecessary data duplication. The `AssetPrice` structure already encapsulates the price information, and returning it from the `reprice()` method is sufficient.

3. Encapsulation and Abstraction: By encapsulating the price information in the `AssetPrice` structure, you can abstract away the details of how the price is determined or calculated within the `Asset` class. This promotes encapsulation and information hiding, making the `Asset` class cleaner and more focused on its core responsibilities.

However, keep in mind that the decision to omit the `price` member variable from the `Asset` class depends on the specific requirements and design considerations of your application. If there are other scenarios or use cases where having direct access to the price within the `Asset` class is necessary, you might consider including the `price` member variable. It ultimately depends on the overall design and behavior of your application.
